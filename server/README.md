# AutoEQ Server
This is a light flask app to make finding and serving the settings and filters
a little more user friendly. To do this the app:
- puts all headphones on a single web page with optimal download options;
- a more detailed per-headphone page that displays the GitHub info; and
- offers a convenient "filters in a zip file" suitable for upload to Roon software.
